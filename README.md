# Predicting-Cardiac-Disease-
  Cardiovascular abnormalities can cause several illnesses that affect the heart's operations, leading to severe consequences such as 
arrhythmia, high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes, and even death. Several machine learning-based methods for predicting and 
diagnosing cardiac disease have recently been introduced. However, these systems cannot manage high-dimensional datasets.
There is a need of an intelligent framework that accurately predicts cardiac disease. Additionally, using traditional methodologies, 
the current algorithms choose characteristics from a dataset and compute a general weight based on their significance. 
These techniques have yet to improve the accuracy of the prediction of cardiac disease. Therefore, an intelligent healthcare system must 
provide high accuracy while decreasing computational time. This research uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier for predicting 
cardiovascular disease by utilizing patient data. The proposed intelligent healthcare system is based on the optimum optimization 
of a DNN classifier's strengths via the Predator Crow Optimization (PCO) approach, which inherited food-seeking tendencies from both 
crow search agents and raiding searching agencies. The proposed model's efficacy and performance are measured in terms of recall, 
accuracy, F1-measure, and precision, which are 96.665%, 97.526%, 97.095%, and 96.424%, respectively. According to the experiment results,
the suggested PCO-DNN module demonstrates the proposed method's efficacy compared to established techniques.
